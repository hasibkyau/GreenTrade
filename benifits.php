            <h1 id="headline">Why do we plant tree?</h1>
            <p id="hp">Trees give off oxygen that we need to breathe. Trees reduce the amount of storm water runoff,
                 which reduces erosion and pollution in our waterways and may reduce the effects of flooding.
                  Many species of wildlife depend on trees for habitat. Trees provide food, protection, and 
                  homes for many birds and mammals.For one thing, the importance of trees is immense for every
                   living being</p>

        <h2 class="Eheading">Environment Benifits</h2>
        <p class="ep">The realization of <span>agroforestry systems</span> allows to make precise choices in relation to
             the specific characteristics and needs of each project area.<span>The tree species planted are native
              or respect the biodiversity of the different territories</span>. The agroforestry practice also 
              integrates the planting of trees in an agricultural system, favoring the virtuous interaction
               between the different species and a sustainable use of resources and land. Finally, all trees 
               <span>absorb CO<sub>2</sub></span> in the course of their growth, naturally generating a benefit for the entire planet.</p>

        <h2 class="Sheading">Social Benifits</h2>
        <p class="sb">Treedom finances projects in rural communities in many countries of the world and also carries out
             projects with a strong social value in Italy. The first step is the training and financing of the communities
              involved in the projects, obtaining extraordinary results in terms of their own empowerment. The trees and
               their fruits belong to the farmers, allowing them to diversify and supplement their income and in some cases
                to launch micro-entrepreneurship initiatives. Financing the planting of new trees with Treedom serves to 
                support the trees' care in the first years of their life, when they are not yet productive in terms of fruit.</p>
